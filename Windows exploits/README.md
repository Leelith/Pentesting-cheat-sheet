# Pre-compiled list of exploits:
[This page - https://github.com/SecWiki/](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits) contains a lot of already compiled windows exploits. Useful when on a rush. Also check [here](https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits) as some may be present or already compiled that is not present on SecWiki.

# Windows exploit suggester
* Based on python and Linux: Available [here](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/win-exp-suggester), works by running systeminfo on the target machine and retrieving the information back to our machine. READ LIMITATIONS [HERE](https://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2014/7/11/introducing-windows-exploit-suggester.html). Direct access to the site also [here](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester) but version from SecWiki is more up to date (first link on the paragraph).
